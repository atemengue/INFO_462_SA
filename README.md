## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of a software architecture for a simple system. The system is a simple online car that allows users to view car, add them to the cart, and place an order. The system is composed of three main components: the client, the server, and the database. The client is a web application that allows users to interact with the system. The server is responsible for processing user requests and interacting with the database. The database is responsible for storing and retrieving data. The system is designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure. The client is implemented using React, the server is implemented using Node.js, and the database is implemented using MongoDB.
